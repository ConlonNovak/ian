PayPal is undoubtedly one of the faster, safer ways to send money and make online payments. Most of the e-commerce websites and online merchants accept PayPal payments.

This blog post is for website owners, merchants and professional bloggers who prefer to receive online payments via PayPal. Without further ado, let&#8217;s look at the best PayPal plugins for WordPress sites and WooCommerce store.

**Note:** I strictly avoided reviewing old WordPress PayPal plugins, and those are not compatible with the latest version of WordPress.

## [PayPal Express Checkout Payment Gateway for WooCommerce][2]

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3882" src="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paypal-express.png" alt="" width="582" height="732" srcset="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paypal-express.png 485w, https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paypal-express-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" />

Are you running a WooCommerce store? Do you plan to integrate express checkout in the product pages? Then this is the plugin you need.  Developed by WebToffe, PayPal Express Checkout Payment Gateway for WooCommerce is a handy plugin that expands the standard PayPal payment option within WooCommerce.

With this PayPal plugin, your potential customer can use their credit card or PayPal balance to make order from cart page itself. This guarantees smoother experience for the users as they never have to leave your website for making payments.

Furthermore, the plugin is well-documented and costs $59.00 if you need the premium version. I highly recommend you to try the live demo before making the purchase.

## [PayPal for WooCommerce][3]

Another plugin ideal for WooCommerce store owners. PayPal for WooCommerce makes it quick and easy for its users to integrate PayPal Express Checkout and Payments Pro into a WordPress / WooCommerce shopping cart system. This plugin fully supports WooCommerce Subscriptions and WooCommerce Payment Tokens as well.

**Note:** Payments Pro is PayPal&#8217;s complete online payment processing solution. By using their plugin, they can get you hooked up with PayPal Payments Pro with no monthly fee (U.S. and Canada merchants only.)

This free plugin has proper documentation, and they&#8217;re quite active on the support forum. It is recommended to read the reviews before installing.

## [Quick Paypal Payments][4] {.plugin-title}

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3862" src="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/quick-paypal-payments.png" alt="Quick PayPal Payments" width="1170" height="667" srcset="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/quick-paypal-payments.png 1170w, https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/quick-paypal-payments-300x171.png 300w, https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/quick-paypal-payments-768x438.png 768w, https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/quick-paypal-payments-700x399.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" />

Just as the name suggests, this free plugin is quite straightforward that lets you accept payments using a shortcode. The plugin now comes with features like Instant Payment Notifications, In-Context Checkout and GDPR compliancy options.

> I searched a lot for WordPress PayPal plugins. Most were bulky and not meeting all my needs. I was building a website for a non-profit and needed to accept donations online with PayPal, with pre-defined or a custom amount. Sounds a simple need but a lot of PayPal plugins did not have this feature. I landed on this plugin and just fell in love with it!
> 
> Very easy to set up. Great customization of the form and its styles. Fantastic support from Graham who wrote this plugin! And a very affordable and deserving price. What else do you want in a plugin?
> 
> Thanks to Graham for building this awesome plugin!

The plugin is known for its straightforwardness, simplicity, and support. Therefore, give it a try if you&#8217;re looking a minimal solution.

## [PayPal Donations][6] {.plugin-title}

Are you running a non-profit organization? Do you need funding for your blog? This plugin comes in handy if you plan to accept donations via PayPal. This Free plugin adds a PayPal donation shortcode and sidebar Widget to WordPress. The options menu lets you set up your PayPal ID and a few other optional settings.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3866" src="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paypal-doantions-widgets-plugin-admin-interface.png" alt="PayPal Donations" width="500" height="909" srcset="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paypal-doantions-widgets-plugin-admin-interface.png 500w, https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paypal-doantions-widgets-plugin-admin-interface-165x300.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

The plugin is well documented and has options available for currency, localization of the button (16 languages), custom payment page style, and the return page. Furthermore, there are optional advanced settings available to fine tune the setup in specific scenarios.

## [Contact Form 7 – PayPal & Stripe Add-on][7] {.plugin-title}

This is another great PayPal plugin that seamlessly integrates PayPal (and Stripe) with Contact Form 7. Each contact form on your website can have its own PayPal & Stripe settings. When a contact form is enabled with PayPal, and the user submits the form it will send the email (as usual) and auto redirects to PayPal.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3981 size-full" src="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/contact-form-7-paypal-plugin.png" alt="" width="455" height="583" srcset="https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/contact-form-7-paypal-plugin.png 455w, https://mighil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/contact-form-7-paypal-plugin-234x300.png 234w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" />

PayPal & Stripe plugin works with both the old and new Contact Form 7 interface. It has got built-in support for 18 languages and 25 currencies. This plugin also allows PayPal testing through SandBox.

The Contact Form 7 – PayPal & Stripe Add-on plugin is intuitive, and the developer is quite active on the support forum to answer the queries.

The pro version of this PayPal plugin comes with handy features including:

  * Send Contact Form 7 email only if the PayPal payment is successful.
