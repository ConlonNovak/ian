<h2>Meaning of the Song (As seen on Edonn.com)</h2>

> Like magic, love appears is replenished through time. And like magic, the moon appears to change through time. But does the moon really change over time?
>
> It’s always the same moon, it’s only how it is viewed that makes it seem different. From certain angles, the moon reflects light in a certain way, from other angles, it reflects light in other ways.
>
> And yet love, though seemingly different, never changes. Underneath the veil of a half-moon, or crescent moon or moonlessness, there is a full moon just waiting to appear.
>
> Add to all this the significance of the moon in Chinese culture, and you get a great song.

Teresa decided to start singing in Japan in 1973, when she signed to Polydor Records of Japan, so she was determined to try her best in studying Japanese.

However, within a short period of 6 months, she was already able to communicate in Japanese with the staff of the company and during meetings. Her first Japanese Album "KONYA KASHIRA? ASHITA KASHIRA?" (Should it be tonight or tomorrow?) was released on March 1, 1974.

<h2>Legacy</h2>

Her music and talent was a dominant and influential force in Asia throughout most of the 1970s and 1980s. Teng was able to move her audiences as much with the sweetness of her voice as with the power of melancholy emotion.

One of the “Five Great Asian Divas”, she was known for driving her audience into rapture, and often tears, over a career that spanned three decades.

<blockquote>Personally- she is one among my favorite singers of the past, present and future era.</blockquote>

Teng’s widespread popularity was also driven by her ability to sing in several languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Indonesian, and English.

Evoking for many precious memories of childhood and happier times, her legacy endures to this day.

By providing an alternative to the most revolutionary songs then prevalent in mainland China, Teng’s emotional rendition of this old Mandarin favorite catapulted her to instant and long-lasting fame that lingers to this day.

Happy 65th birthday, Teresa Teng!
