## About

**It’s kind of you to stop by.** I’m Mighil, a digital marketing consultant (organic growth marketing specialist), and SEO expert formerly from Calicut but currently based in Chengdu, China. I was a student of Anna University, Chennai but decided to drop-out and learn, embrace and master something called organic marketing a.k.a the most profitable business strategy.

## Stuff I Do

Since 2012, I’m actively learning and embracing the beauty of how search engines work. I believe I can consult small and medium-sized businesses on the same topic. I always love to develop marketing campaigns on the principles of generating high-quality content in all forms. Get in touch with me today for a free consultation.*

I have both domestic and hands-on international experience when it comes to digital marketing. I’ve previously worked with WebNamaste (IN), IOSS (IN), Acodez (IN), IObit (CN), ugChain (SG), LabEx (HK) and a few others.

## Stuff I like

I don’t read a lot (offline), but papers on absurdism and existentialism = biriyani to me. I do watch a lot of movies. I’m more into horror, mystery and comedy flicks. I’m a true Gojira fanboy.

## Music

I used to produce experimental electronic music under the monikers base32, Xonikk, and Longma. Here’s a <a href="https://xonikk.bandcamp.com/" rel="noopener">bunch</a> you can listen now. I’d love to come up with a synthwave EP someday.
