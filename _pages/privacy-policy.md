<h3><del>Web Fonts</del> Mighil.com Renders Your System Font Stack</h3>
A “system font stack” is basically a way of telling the web browser to use the font your operating system is already using.

This site uses the following CSS to render the system font stack:
<pre>body {font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";}
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,.home-text {font-family:-apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";}</pre>
<del>For uniform representation of fonts, this page occasionally uses web fonts provided by Google &amp; Adobe Typekit. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</del>

<del>For this purpose, your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google Servers and Adobe Typekit servers. Google and Adobe thus become aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address.</del>

<del>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</del>
